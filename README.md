## Git Hashing Exercise, Operating Systems, 2024-2025

The goal of this exercise is to create a shell script that takes as input a 4-digit number and saves the hash value of this input in a file named hash_output.txt.
The hashing algorithm used was SHA-256.

## Usage:

- Make the script executable : ``chmod +x hash_script``
- Run the script with a four-digit number as input: ``./hash_script 1234``
- The output will be saved in hash_output.txt. To view the file, use: ``cat hash_output.txt``
